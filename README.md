# Project-Computer-Vision-for-Exam-Invigilation
In this project, we have created a virtual examination surveillance system that will be able to monitor the examinees throughout the period of an examination. Computers are trained to detect ‘inappropriate’ motions of the candidates during an examination. We have used Viola Jones Object Detection Algorithm for the detecting such ‘inappropriate’ motions. We have also attempted to create a simple user interface to highlights specific minutes or seconds where cheating like movements happened with links to the video clips of those specific sections.
