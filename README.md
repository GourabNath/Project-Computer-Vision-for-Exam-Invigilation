# What if Computers Invigilate Examinations?
Examination malpractices remain a bother in the educational system. With so much of strictness being introduced inside the examination halls, which includes preventing the examinees to carry their own materials, putting students under active surveillance by multiple invigilators and even fixing CCTV cameras inside the examination halls, our project focuses on what is the next thing we are likely to see in this practice. In this project, we have created a virtual examination supervision system that will be able to check the examinees throughout the period of the examination. Computers would be trained to detect ‘inappropriate’ motions of the candidates during an examination. We have also attempted to create a simple user interface to highlight specific minutes or seconds where cheating like movements happened with links to the video clips of those specific instances.
